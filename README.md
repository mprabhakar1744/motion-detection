# motion-detection
Moving target detection and classification is widely used for security purposes. Here a system is presented which performs the required task of moving object detection, and classification to make the whole system autonomous. First task is to detect the moving object in an image or frame, secondly classify the detected object and track it.     The system contains one Camera for video capturing, python module for processing and a computer system.         Camera is fixed on a platform, which will capture out the moving object. The computer system is used for processing of image/video frame-by-frame. Real time video stream is provided to computer by Camera. Algorithms for detection and tracking are written in Python.    In this system the detection and classification are taken out through software. After detection and tracking of moving object, the object is locked. As a result where ever object will move within the camera view, the notification is generated to the concern authority and thus makes the whole system autonomous.
